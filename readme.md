# Monte Carlo Simulation of Dice Roll Sums

## Simulation Details

- **Number of Trials:** 100,000
- **Dice Sides:** 6
- **Possible Sums:** 2 to 12

The Monte Carlo method simulates the rolling of two dice and counts the occurrences of each possible sum. The probability of each sum is then calculated by dividing the number of occurrences by the total number of trials.

### Analytical Probabilities

The analytical probabilities for the sums of two six-sided dice are well-known and can be calculated based on the total number of possible outcomes (36). The distribution of probabilities for each sum is as follows:

| Sum | Analytical Probability (%) | Monte Carlo Result (%) |
|-----|----------------------------|------------------------|
| 2   | 2.78                       | 2.801                  |
| 3   | 5.56                       | 5.566                  |
| 4   | 8.33                       | 8.293                  |
| 5   | 11.11                      | 10.935                 |
| 6   | 13.89                      | 13.878                 |
| 7   | 16.67                      | 16.772                 |
| 8   | 13.89                      | 13.949                 |
| 9   | 11.11                      | 11.083                 |
| 10  | 8.33                       | 8.372                  |
| 11  | 5.56                       | 5.554                  |
| 12  | 2.78                       | 2.777                  |

### Results

The Monte Carlo simulation closely approximates the analytical probabilities when the number of trials is sufficiently large (e.g., 100,000). The simulation results showed minor variations, which is expected due to the random nature of the simulation.

### Impact of Number of Trials

- **Higher Number of Trials:** As the number of trials increases, the Monte Carlo simulation becomes more accurate, and the results converge to the analytical probabilities. The law of large numbers ensures that the observed frequencies become closer to the expected probabilities with a higher number of trials.
- **Lower Number of Trials:** If the number of trials is too low, the simulation results may deviate significantly from the analytical probabilities. The variability is higher with fewer trials, resulting in less reliable estimates.

## Conclusion

The Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method to approximate the probability distribution of the sum of two dice. It provides results that are consistent with theoretical expectations, especially when a large number of trials is performed. This method is useful for estimating probabilities in scenarios where analytical calculations are difficult or impossible.
